            <p class="text-rice-white mb-4">I remember feeling very weird and awkward cold-emailing my first time because I had never done it before, and there is something so weird about contacting someone you have never met. However, after cold-emailing a bunch of people, I learned so much.</p>
            <p class="text-rice-white mb-4">I learned how to communicate with people I've never met before, face to face, and it really helped with my networking skills in the future. It has led me to various opportunities and meet some very cool people I can be in touch with today.</p>
            <p class="text-rice-white">It has also provided me with some form of rejection therapy because not everyone you email is going to see it, and not getting a response is okay. It might just mean there is another opportunity somewhere else or force you to contact someone who might end up helping you out in the long run.</p>

            <p class="text-rice-white mb-4">Cold emailing people about augmented reality—a space I initially knew nothing about—was surprisingly rewarding. I was amazed by how willing people were to explain concepts, connect me with others, and share similar ideas or considerations.</p>
            <p class="text-rice-white mb-4">Beyond just providing information, many encouraged me, highlighted the potential of my ideas, and motivated me to keep exploring. It changed my perspective on cold emailing, showing me that people are often eager to help if you take the initiative to reach out even if you are not the smartest or most experienced person in the world.</p>
            <p class="text-rice-white">As a finance major, and a student athlete, I had a little to offer but honestly was about to learn about unique facets in the space, similar ideas, and even expand my network beyond my inital cold email.</p>

            <p class="text-rice-white mb-4">I think the most surprising thing that happened to me after cold emailing was learning how receptive people are no matter their position. No one is too big to reach out to, and often the one who you think wont were my favorite ones to speak with.</p>
            <p class="text-rice-white mb-4">The biggest thing I learned from cold emailing was to be true to who you are. While you are trying to get a response, you are not selling them something. The new opportunities i gained were simply more connections within my field. This helped because in the Oil and Gas industry it is a lot about who you know, and the more the merrier.</p>
            <p class="text-rice-white">My perspective has changed from seeing it as a daunting task and being scared to press that send button, to doing it much more often because you do indeed miss all of the shots you don't take.</p>

            <p class="text-rice-white mb-4">I started off the cold email grind trying to send as many as possible, but I quickly realized that I was not going to get the responses I needed in time. Instead, I focused on reaching out to people I either had a mutual connection with or shared something in common.</p>
            <p class="text-rice-white mb-4">Since I've been using a Boosted Board (electric skateboard) for years, I decided to email the founder, sharing how the product had impacted my daily life and asking for advice on breaking into his industry. To my surprise, he responded, appreciated my enthusiasm, and agreed to get on a call.</p>
            <p class="text-rice-white">After an insightful conversation, he offered to be a resource to me in the future and gave me his personal contact information. With so many cold emails flooding inboxes, the key is to write with genuine intent—reach out to people with whom you have a real connection or a compelling reason to start a conversation.</p>

            <p class="text-rice-white mb-4">When exploring the idea of a startup nonprofit, I reached out to two professionals in the non-profit sector who had years of for-profit experience under their belt. I expected to just ask about their experience in the non-profit world and receive feedback on my startup idea, but the conversation flowed naturally to their for-profit experience.</p>
            <p class="text-rice-white mb-4">They both encouraged my short-term goal of pursuing a career in consulting and my long-term passion for applying that experience to the non-profit world. Although they really liked my startup idea, I was surprised that both professionals were more interested in me and helping me meet my career goals than my idea and how I can be useful to them.</p>
            <p class="text-rice-white">They were really willing to sacrifice time just to chat. I learned that while we, of course, want to be respectful of professionals' time, the ones who respond to cold emails actually want to help you, even though they don't know you! People are cool. :)</p>

            <p class="text-rice-white mb-4">While taking Disco, I was really interested in team effectiveness coaching, especially as it related to athletics. After cold emailing a variety of people, I got in contact with a sports trainer who was looking to motivate his group of athletes.</p>
            <p class="text-rice-white mb-4">In our conversation I learned more about the challenges his athletes were facing with burnout and the strategies he had used. He asked me for some of my insights, and at the end of the conversation, he even offered me a job. It was totally unexpected.</p>
            <p class="text-rice-white">My perspective on cold emailing changed after Disco because now, I no longer see it as awkward or intimidating but a great way to increase my "luck surface area". It is amazing the things that can happen when you just put yourself out there and make more connections.</p>

            <p class="text-rice-white mb-4">One interesting takeaway was how their system enables an infinite number of weights possible in the analog format, making it far more power-efficient than traditional AI.</p>

I definitely did not expect to get as many responses as I did, and I think this was due to the fact that I only reached out to Rice alumni.</p>
            <p class="text-rice-white mb-4">Rice alumni are much more likely to respond as they already have something in common with you and want to help out a fellow owl. In this cold email learning process, I learned how to find people's email's using email finders, and I also learned how to have good coffee chats with people.</p>
            <p class="text-rice-white">This assignment gave me the confidence to have coffee chats with different people at the company I'm interning for and it is an extremely valuable skill.</p>

            <p class="text-rice-white mb-4">In the end, I sent around seventy and received maybe five replies.

            <p class="text-rice-white mb-4">I met another 221 alumnus the other week and he echoed the same sentiment. I am currently thinking of starting another business, and cold emailing will prove integral to my success.</p>
            <p class="text-rice-white">Cold emailing has brought me opportunities to speak to some very skilled people in their industry, and often times for extended periods of time -- I got to speak to a very, very skilled photographer for an hour! Lastly, remember to politely follow-up (checking up on something) after a few days if they don't respond.</p>

After having around a 2 hour conversation with him, I guess he thought I was capable, and then offered me an internship with his startup.</p>
            <p class="text-rice-white mb-4">The internship was really insightful and I was able to connect with important people I still reach out to occasionally.

            <p class="text-rice-white mb-4">I got to talk to the head of culinary at Sweetgreen which was an incredible opportunity for me through cold emailing. That whole interview was surprising to me because I was talking to such an influential person.</p>
            <p class="text-rice-white mb-4">I learned about culinary school and the corporate food space. After cold-emailing this person he told me to talk to one of his colleagues and opened other doors.</p>
            <p class="text-rice-white">I think after Disco I am more confident when it comes to cold emailing and am more likely to do so when pursing internships and other opportunities in the future.</p>

            <p class="text-rice-white mb-4">I cold emailed about a career I was interested in, and two of the people I interviewed had vastly different opinions and perspectives. One interviewee really enjoyed the job, while the other spoke very negatively about it.</p>
            <p class="text-rice-white mb-4">Although, their perspectives differed because they were at very different stages in life when considering/entering this job. As a result, this was a very insightful interview because aspects of whether the job could be right for someone depends on more than just the job itself, which is not something I considered.</p>
            <p class="text-rice-white">Doing the interviews ultimately opened up many perspectives that I would have otherwise never known.</p>

            <p class="text-rice-white mb-4">I remember when we first were given the cold email assignment, I was very fearful of getting rejected and ignored by those I reached out to. After my first few emails with no response, I was really nervous that I wasn't going to meet the interview threshold.</p>
            <p class="text-rice-white mb-4">However, after my first interview with a Rice senior, she connected me to a MIT PhD student, and from there, the interviews just kept building upon each other. From the interviews, I learned a lot about how my interests could translate into future career prospects.</p>
            <p class="text-rice-white">Even after Disco, I have found the skill of cold emailing extremely useful in my other academic prospects. This summer, I'm attempting to get a study abroad research scholarship, and I'm currently having to perform the "daunting" task of cold emailing professors in a foreign country. Due to Disco teaching me how to properly cold email, I've already received multiple responses from professors, and I'm sure this will be a skill I take with me long into the future.</p>

            <p class="text-rice-white mb-4">One of the most surprising outcomes from cold emailing was receiving a response from Martín Casado and having the opportunity to speak with him. Casado is a General Partner at Andreessen Horowitz and a pioneer in software-defined networking. I had recently watched an interview he conducted with Mira Murati, who was the CTO of OpenAI. That conversation made me curious about his perspective on building and scaling technical products.</p>
            <p class="text-rice-white mb-4">As someone interested in both computer science and entrepreneurship, I wanted to understand how technical founders navigate the transition from building innovative products to creating successful companies. One key takeaway from our conversation was the importance of timing in startups and solving real business problems. He explained that even the best ideas can struggle if the market isn't ready for them, while sometimes a simple idea succeeds because external conditions align at the right moment.</p>
            <p class="text-rice-white mb-4">So it's not just about having a great product, but also about recognizing the right go-to-market strategy, and in some cases, the right timing. I also remember discussing his routine and his emphasis on deep focus and structure. Casado spoke about how he values structuring his days to maximize focus and eliminate distractions, which allows him to engage with complex problems.</p>
            <p class="text-rice-white">The most difficult part of cold emailing is often getting a response, so it's essential to craft a message that stands out. Despite this challenge, it can lead to valuable conversations, new insights, and unexpected opportunities.</p>

            <p class="text-rice-white mb-4">Cold emailing is an essential professional skill that everyone should learn. I love the saying, "You miss 100% of the shots you don't take," and it applies perfectly here. What surprised me most was how willing professionals, especially Rice alums, are to speak with undergraduates—especially when you're working on something interesting.</p>
            <p class="text-rice-white mb-4">During the cold email exercise in BUSI 221, I connected with a few Rice graduates and learned about job opportunities I didn't even know existed. After the course, my team used cold emailing to reach out to surgeons for an engineering project, and we got some really great responses and feedback.</p>
            <p class="text-rice-white">We even had the chance to observe a kidney transplant surgery at Houston Methodist, explore medical engineering technologies, and are currently in process of bringing on a transplant surgeon as our medical advisor. Cold emailing might not seem immediately impactful during the course, but it's a skill you'll use often and find highly effective in the long run.</p>
