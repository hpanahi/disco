                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-rice-gold">Understanding Possibility Statements</h3>
                <p>In Disco, you're exploring two possibility statements - guesses about potential futures you might pursue. A possibility statement has three parts:</p>
                <div class="bg-rice-blue border-l-4 border-rice-gold p-4 my-4">
                    <p class="italic">"I will provide my ability to <strong>________</strong> (the what - what value you'll provide) so that I can help <strong>________</strong> (the who - the people you want to help) because <strong>________</strong> (the why - the reason you want to help and/or the outcome you want them to achieve)"</p>
                </div>

                <h4 class="font-semibold text-rice-gold mt-4">Your Two Possibility Statements:</h4>
                <ul class="list-none space-y-2 ml-4">
                    <li><strong>ðŸŽ“ Most Feasible:</strong> The one you would choose if you had to decide tomorrow. The most sensible and possible path.</li>
                    <li><strong>ðŸš€ Most Revolutionary:</strong> The one that makes your heart sing - maybe a hobby or passion you don't know how to turn into a future. Exciting, even if it seems unattainable.</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="font-semibold text-rice-gold mt-4">These are starting points, not final decisions. You may not even know if these possibilities are possible! That's okay - you'll do research to find out.</p>

                <h4 class="font-semibold text-rice-gold mt-6 text-lg">The Numbers Game: Why You Need to Contact Many People</h4>

                <p class="mt-2">You need <strong>4 high-quality, 30-minute+ conversations</strong> - these are conversations with people who can give you specific, ungoogleable insights about whether your possibility statement is grounded in reality.</p>

                <p class="mt-2"><strong>To get 4 quality conversations, you'll likely need to contact around 50 people.</strong></p>

                <p class="mt-2">Cold emailing is a numbers game. Not everyone will respond. Some will be too busy. Some won't be the right fit once you explore further. That's completely normal and not personal. To generate the luck you're looking for, you need to reach out to LOTS of people.</p>

                <p class="mt-2">This guide shows you how to use AI tools to research people deeply and efficiently - because when you're contacting 50 people, you need a system that scales.</p>

                <p class="font-semibold text-rice-gold mt-4">Remember that coffee chats aren't about asking people to hire you or validate your idea. They're about testing your possibility statement through real conversations. The better your research, the better your emails, the higher your response rate - but you still need volume.</p>
