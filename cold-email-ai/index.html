                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-rice-gold">Understanding Possibility Statements</h3>
                <p>In Disco, you're exploring two possibility statements - guesses about potential futures you might pursue. A possibility statement has three parts:</p>
                <div class="bg-rice-blue border-l-4 border-rice-gold p-4 my-4">
                    <p class="italic">"I will provide my ability to <strong>________</strong> (the what - what value you'll provide) so that I can help <strong>________</strong> (the who - the people you want to help) because <strong>________</strong> (the why - the reason you want to help and/or the outcome you want them to achieve)"</p>
                </div>

                <h4 class="font-semibold text-rice-gold mt-4">Your Two Possibility Statements:</h4>
                <ul class="list-none space-y-2 ml-4">
                    <li><strong>ðŸŽ“ Most Feasible:</strong> The one you would choose if you had to decide tomorrow. The most sensible and possible path.</li>
                    <li><strong>ðŸš€ Most Revolutionary:</strong> The one that makes your heart sing - maybe a hobby or passion you don't know how to turn into a future. Exciting, even if it seems unattainable.</li>
                </ul>

        
                <p class="mt-2">To explore these possibility statements, you need <strong>4 high-quality, 30-minute+ conversations</strong> - these are conversations with people who can give you specific, ungoogleable insights about whether your possibility statement is grounded in reality.</p>

                <p class="mt-2"><strong>To get 4 quality conversations, you'll likely need to contact around 50 people.</strong></p>

                <p class="mt-2">Cold emailing is a numbers game. Not everyone will respond. Some will be too busy. Some won't be the right fit once you explore further. That's completely normal and not personal. To generate the luck you're looking for, you need to reach out to LOTS of people.</p>

                <p class="mt-2">This guide shows you how to use AI tools to research people deeply and efficiently - because when you're contacting 50 people, you need a system that scales.</p>

                <p class="mt-4">Remember that coffee chats aren't about asking people to hire you or validate your idea. They're about testing your possibility statement through real conversations. The better your research, the better your emails, the higher your response rate - but you still need volume.</p>

I'm building a list of people to contact for coffee chats about my possibility statement.
I want to prioritize people who are closer connections with me for higher response rates.

Here's my background:

EDUCATION:
- Current: [University], [Major], Class of [Year]
- High School: [School Name], [City], [State/Country]
- Study abroad / exchange programs: [if any]
- Other education: [online courses, bootcamps, etc.]

PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE:
- Internships: [Company, role, dates]
- Projects: [Notable projects or research]
- Part-time work: [Any relevant work]

LOCATION HISTORY:
- Hometown: [City, State/Country]
- Places I've lived: [Cities where you've spent significant time]
- Family background: [e.g., "grew up in Texas", "family from Vietnam"]

INTERESTS & ACTIVITIES:
- Sports/hobbies: [specific activities you do regularly]
- Clubs/organizations: [campus groups, volunteer work]
- Passions: [things you genuinely care about]

SKILLS & EXPERTISE:

- Soft skills: [areas where you have real experience]

My possibility statement:
WHO: [who you want to help]
WHAT: [skills/value you want to provide]
WHY: [outcomes you want to create]

Based on all of this, help me:
1. Identify the STRONGEST connection points I have (rank them by likelihood of response)
2. Suggest types of people who might share these connections
3. Generate 10-15 LinkedIn search strategies that prioritize these connections
4. Tell me which connections to lead with in cold emails

Focus on authentic connections - things that would genuinely make someone more likely
to respond to a Rice student.</pre>

I'm a Rice University student exploring a possibility statement. This is a guess about a future I might pursue - I'm not sure yet if it's even possible, but I want to research it.

A possibility statement follows this format:
"I will provide my ability to ________ (the what) so that I can help ________ (the who) because ________ (the why)"

I'm building a list of people to contact for coffee chats about my possibility statement.

I need 15-20 LinkedIn search queries that will help me find people who:
1. Are relevant to my possibility statement
2. Share connections with me (for higher response rates)

My background:
- School: [Your University], [Major], Class of [Year]
- High School: [School Name] in [City, State]
- Hometown: [City]
- Interests: [3-5 specific interests/hobbies]
- Experience: [Key internships, projects, or skills]

My possibility statement:
WHO: [who you want to help]
WHAT: [skills you want to provide]
WHY: [outcomes you want to create]

For each search query, provide:
1. The exact LinkedIn search string (using boolean operators: AND, OR, NOT, quotes)
2. Which connection point it leverages (e.g., "Rice alumni", "Houston hometown")
3. Why this search would find relevant people for my possibility statement
4. Approximate seniority level to expect

Organize the searches in priority order:
- Tier 1 (strongest connections): 5 searches
- Tier 2 (good connections): 5 searches
- Tier 3 (relevant but no personal connection): 5 searches

Make the searches specific enough to return 50-200 results each, not thousands.</pre>

I'm exploring a possibility statement (a guess about a potential future path).
I want to talk to them to see if this possibility is grounded in reality.

A possibility statement follows this format:
"I will provide my ability to ________ (the what) so that I can help ________ (the who) because ________ (the why)"

My possibility statement:
WHO: [Who you want to serve/work with]
WHAT: [Skills you want to provide/role you want to have]
WHY: [Benefits and outcomes you hope to create]

Please search the web and help me find:
1. Their current role and recent work (last 6-12 months)
2. Their professional background and career path
3. What they're interested in or care about professionally
4. Recent articles, talks, podcasts, or projects they've been involved in
5. Any public writing (blog posts, LinkedIn articles, Twitter/X posts, Substack)
6. Whether they have any connection to Rice University

Focus on information from the last 6-12 months - recent activity is most valuable.</pre>
